4. interface in java is a class which can have static constants and abstract methods.
It cannot have concrete methods and it can be used to specify the service requirement specifications(SRS)

5.By making the use of interface we can ensure that we implement all the reauired features this can be done by implementing the
interface. implements is the keywors used to implement the interface.
We can also acheive loose coupling by making  use of interface.

6.Lambda expression in java can be used to implement the functional interface.
An interface is said to be functional interface if it has only one abstract method and we write lambda expression
to implement that interface in a specifice syntax.
It saves a lot of code. In case of lambda expression, we don't need to define the method again for providing the implementation. 
Here, we just write the implementation code.

7. yes we can pass a lambda expression to another method when the method is accepting a parameter of type functional interface.

8.An interface is said to be functional interface if it has only one abstract method and it can have any number of default methods and
 static methods even

9.less coding, efficient way of implementation

10. no it is not mandatory  for lambda expression to have parameters.
